## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Pandas, NumPy** → data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → visualizations  
- **scikit-learn** → train/test split, classification  

---

## 🔍 Analysis
- Checked for missing values  
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Id`)  
- Visualized dataset using boxplots, histograms, pairplots  
- Distribution of classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning
Split into training and test sets (80/20).  
Trained simple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict **species** based on sepal and petal features.  

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved >90% accuracy on test set (varies by model).  
- Clear separation of classes in pairplot visualizations.  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try advanced models (RandomForest, SVM).  
- Compare model performance with cross-validation.
